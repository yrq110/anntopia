# Geometry

This package contains computing geometry algorithms and split into the following categories:

* [**Curve**](/geometry/curve) - multiple types of interpolating spline
* [**Bounding Box**](/geometry/bounding-box) - the minimum or smallest bounding or enclosing box
* [**Convex Hull**](/geometry/convex-hull) - the smallest convex set that contains target points 
* [**Triangulation**](/geometry/triangulation) - determining the location of a point by forming triangles to the point from known points
* [**Boolean Operation**](/geometry/boolean-operation) - a set of Boolean Operation on one or more sets of primitives
* [**Distance**](/geometry/distance) - min/max distance or path among points 
* [**Area**](/geometry/area) - get target area from point set or polygon
